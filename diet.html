        <h1>Recommended Daily Diet</h1>

        <p>
            In the wild, Cockatiels feed at ground level, eating berries, fruits, grass seeds, grains and many other foods. 
            Therefore, it's very important for them to have a varied diet in captivity for them to recieve the required intake of the same nutrients and vitamins as they would in the wild. <br>
            Their diet should consist of:<br><br>
            <p class = "standout">60 - 70% should be made up of <strong>pellets</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Each store bought pellet will have measured and balanced nutrition so they get what they need</li>
                <li>These are better than a seed heavy diet (as often provided by owners) as Cockatiels usually selectively pick their favourite seeds to eat and discard the vitamin rich seed hulls. Seeds also have a high fat content which isn't ideal for everyday meals.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <p class = "standout">10 - 30% should be made up of <strong>fresh vegetables, fruits and protein</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>They have high vitamin requirements so dark green vegetables and others with a variety of nutrients are benificial</li>
                <li>Some reccomended for their high vitamin A content include <i>bell peppers, carrots, sweet potatoes, tomatoes</i> which are to be eaten in in small quantities</li>
                <li>Others to try include: <i>peas, broccoli, kale, spinach, carrot, sweet potato, a small amount of sprouted seeds, legumes, chick-weed and dandelion</i></li>
            </ul>
              <br>
            <p class = "standout">5% should be snacks and treats</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Snacks (like seeds and rewards) should be monitered to not make up too much of their diet due to high fat contents</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
